# Canvas Hide Old Courses

Really basic QOL extension to hide old course on Canvas LMS. Frequently Professors forget to mark a class as finished, so the course stays in your current enrollment listing. This chrome extension identifies these courses and moves them visually to the the past enrollments. This makes no effect on the actual Canvas database, it is just a HTML visual effect.

This is not on the Chrome WebStore, it is too niche for anyone but me. If you want to use it, download this folder and load the extension in Developer Mode as an Unpacked Extension.
