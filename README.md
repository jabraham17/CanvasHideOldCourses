# Canvas Hide Old Courses

Really basic QOL extension to hide old course on Canvas LMS. Frequently Professors forget to mark a class as finished, so the course stays in your current enrollement listing. This chrome extension identifies these courses and moves them viuslly to the the past enrollments. This makes no effect on the actual Canvas database, it is just a HTML visual effect.
